<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Viktor Tukora.
  I was born in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, and grew up in a small town not far from it called Isaszeg.
  Growing up there was amazing as a kid, since it was a village everybody knew everyone about
  and there was a sense of community and safety. There were lots of wildlife and nature.
  I always spent the whole day outside either playing in a big field next to our house or just roaming the streets with my friends, 
  or just playing in the garden with the family dogs, sandbox, etc..</p>

<p>Eventually, part of my family moved to the United Kingdom, 
  including me, and I have been living here since 2014. 
  I still try and travel back home at least twice a year to be with my grandparents 
  and the rest of my family.</p>

<p>I am currently 31 years old. I exercise every day and I practice Mixed Martial Arts. 
  So far, I've had one sanctioned fight in Wolverhampton which I won in the first round by tko. 
  My other hobbies include ; collecting books, old video games from the 80s-90s up to the current releases, 
  watch collecting and repairing, collecting Lego Star Wars, cooking, especially outdoor cooking and, 
  of course, last, but not least, coding.
